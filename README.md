As an extroverted data and AI strategist, I bridge people, technology, and business to unlock strategic impact. With a talent for cutting through corporate complexity, I empower teams with advanced tools and actionable insights that drive smarter, faster decisions.

When I’m not working, I still fuel up on coffee and curiosity, staying sharp by exploring emerging trends in tech, business, and big ideas, from economics to psychology to philosophy. I’m also into backpacking, global travel, puzzle cubes, guitar, music, gaming, wine tasting, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

MBTI: ENTP (Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Perceiving).
Top 5 CliftonStrengths: Activator, Ideation, Futuristic, Strategic, and Command.
